# moments
A nearly finished pure JavaScript Image Gallery.

Languages: CSS, HTML, Bootstrap CSS, JavaScript

To Do: Complete Lightbox and Carousel functionality. Need to solve for dynamic images rather than static in carousel.js by appending state change to the parent element.

Long-term Goals: Incorporate dynamic API calls based on timezone in the user's browser to present certain "zen moments" for their particular time of day. Create a date prototype with year, month and time parameters. Use getTimezoneOffset() for localization.
